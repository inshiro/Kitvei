**Note:** This is a personal project of mine that I've released publicly. Therefore it is a work in-progress. If you break it, let me know!


## Motivation
I wanted a pure English Bible which was not tampered by men who added or removed parts of scripture, mainly because they used alternate manuscripts that deviated from the original. I stumbled upon the PCE and this translation did well in preserving the original into our lexicon. I'm convinced The Word is perfect but translations can have mistakes. As for English, this is currently the best translation we have, but do make sure to confirm with the original Greek and Hebrew.

### Issues

In any project it's likely that a few bugs will slip through the cracks, so it
helps greatly if people document any bugs they find to ensure that they get
fixed promptly.

You can view a list of known issues and feature requests using [the issue tracker](
https://github.com/inshiro/Kitvei/issues). If you don't see your issue (or you
aren't sure) feel free to [submit it!](https://github.com/inshiro/Kitvei/issues/new)

Where appropriate, a screenshot works wonders to help us see exactly what the
issue is. You can upload screenshots directly using the GitHub issue tracker or
by attaching a link (to Imgur, for example), whichever is easier for you.

### Code

If you are a developer and wish to contribute to the app please fork the project
and submit a pull request.

If you have any questions, feel free to [send me an email](<mailto:iitsbalance@gamil.com>)
